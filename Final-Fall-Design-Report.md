## ABET Concerns Essay

My gravity-based energy storage system design is under several constraints across economic,
environmental, ethical, and professional areas. Economically, the project is limited by a small budget,
which affects the scale of testing and the choice of materials. To stay within budget, I plan to use low-
cost components, the 1819 Innovation Hub, and open-source control software. Environmentally, the
design seeks to promote renewable energy use by offering a cleaner alternative to battery storage.
However, it must also minimize its own footprint by using recyclable materials and avoiding too much
energy use in testing. Ethically, I am responsible for ensuring the design operates safely under load and
that all data on system performance are accurately reported. Preventing mechanical failure and ensuring
safety are top priorities. Professionally, this project develops my engineering skills by applying
mechanical, electrical, and systems design principles within recognized standards. It also encourages
professional integrity through documentation, reliability testing, and accountability. These constraints
collectively shape a design that is affordable, sustainable, and responsible, aligning with the broader
goals of clean energy innovation.

## Self-Assessment Essays

### Paragraph 1 – Introduction

My senior design project focuses on developing a gravity-based renewable energy storage system that
serves as a sustainable alternative to batteries. Since I am working alone on this project, I will be
responsible for every aspect, from design and modeling to software development and testing. My
academic background in computer science allows me to approach the project with a strong emphasis on
software control, simulation, and optimization. The concept of gravity-based storage is innovative
because it relies on a simple principle—lifting and lowering a mass—to store and release energy in a
reliable way. By applying my skills to the challenges of energy efficiency and system integration, I aim
to design a solution that demonstrates both technical feasibility and environmental impact.

### Paragraph 2 – Curriculum Experiences

My college coursework has prepared me well to take on this project independently. In CS3093C
(Software Engineering), I learned how to structure software projects, manage version control, and test
effectively, all of which will guide my development process. EECE4029 (Operating Systems) gave me
a deeper understanding of resource management, concurrency, and scheduling—knowledge that can
directly apply to building efficient algorithms for the storage system. In CS4071 (Design and Analysis
of Algorithms), I gained the skills to design optimization routines that can improve the system’s energy
usage patterns. Finally, CS2028C (Data Structures) gave me the ability to store, retrieve, and
manipulate data efficiently, which will be important for analyzing test results. Collectively, these
courses not only strengthened my technical expertise but also reinforced the importance of clear
documentation and problem-solving, both of which I will apply in my project.

### Paragraph 3 – Co-op Experiences

My co-op experiences have provided me with both technical and professional skills that will guide the
development of my project. At Boston Beer Company, I worked as an Automation Engineer Co-op,
where I gained experience with process automation, system reliability, and data collection. This role
taught me how to integrate software with physical equipment and troubleshoot systems under real-
world conditions. At Fives Cincinnati, I served as a Controls Engineer Co-op, where I worked on PLC
programming, industrial automation, and control system design. This experience strengthened my
ability to connect software logic with mechanical processes—an important skill for building a gravity-
based energy storage prototype. Both positions also developed my non-technical skills, such as
working independently, adapting to new technologies, and managing multiple responsibilities at once,
which will help me navigate the challenges of completing this project alone.

### Paragraph 4 – Motivation

I am motivated to work on this project because it directly addresses one of the most pressing issues of
our time: renewable energy storage. Gravity-based systems are exciting to me because they are elegant,
low-maintenance, and environmentally friendly compared to chemical batteries. As someone passionate
about sustainability, I am excited to contribute to exploring alternatives that could make renewable
energy more practical and affordable. The fact that I am working independently makes the project even
more rewarding, since it allows me to take ownership of the design, development, and outcome. By
applying both my academic and professional experiences, I see this as an opportunity not only to solve
a technical problem but also to show the impact that a single engineer can make.

### Paragraph 5 – Preliminary Approach and Self-Evaluation

My preliminary approach to the project will be to start with a simulation of the energy storage system,
using mathematical models to predict how much energy can be stored and released under different
conditions. Once the simulation is reliable, I will develop software controls and test them against
hardware models or prototypes. My expected results include a functioning model that demonstrates the
workability of gravity-based energy storage, along with software tools that track and optimize
performance. I will evaluate my contributions by setting measurable goals such as simulation accuracy,
reliability of control logic, and clarity of system reporting. I will consider the project successful when I
have produced a system that operates consistently, delivers reliable performance data, and shows
potential for scaling into larger energy storage applications.
