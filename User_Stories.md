As a renewable energy operator, I want to store excess solar and wind energy using a gravity-based system, so that I can provide power when generation is low.

As a homeowner, I want an affordable and low-maintenance energy storage solution, so that I can have electricity without depending on fossil fuels.

As a city planner, I want scalable energy storage infrastructure, so that I can improve grid resilience and support the transition to renewable energy.

As an engineer, I want to monitor and optimize the performance of a gravity-based energy storage prototype, so that I can validate its efficiency and viability.

As an investor, I want to evaluate the cost savings and environmental benefits of gravity-based storage, so that I can make funding decisions.
